# Parti-Face [PROVISIONAL]

Parti-Face, short for "Partial Face," is a hybrid machine learning model designed to enhance face detection, particularly for occluded faces. By integrating the RetinaFace architecture with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other techniques, this project aims to push the boundaries of existing benchmarks in face detection.
